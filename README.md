# Buckwheat!

This is a simple demonstration of SVG capabilities on the client-side, and what
better project than one that educates people at the same time! I have a passion
for our environment, and buckwheat is my favorite class of soldier in the war 
against over-consumption. Feel free to fork, clone, or do whatever you please to
it! I hope you gain something out of this project, even if it's just a fun fact!
